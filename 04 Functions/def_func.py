    print('This is an example of a function in Python.') # This is the function's body.

# Importantly, the first char of a function cannot be a number.
# This function does not return any values - they are void functions.

# before the function is executed.

# Functions that return one or more vars are often much more interesting.

def addtwo(a, b) :

secret = addtwo(3,2)
print(x,secret)

# I altered the function above to return multiple values as a tuple. Convenient!
